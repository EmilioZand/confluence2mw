The ability for a business user to define configure and administer commission rates and amounts applied at an individual product level, at a risk item level and at a coverage level. A "commission strategy" specifies the amount of commission to be applied at each level. Default commission values are to be applied when no commission value is explicitly set. The default commission rate is zero. The period when a commission strategy will be applied at a product, risk item or coverage level is determined in the administration of the commission strategy.
