confluence2mw
=============

Takes a directory of confluence files from loki, downloads the converted mediawiki markup to the local HDD
Finds all of the corrisponding attachments from loki and downloads them under into a resources drive on the local HDD

Directory URL, local HDD directory are configurable in the convert.properties file.

Currently there are bugs rooting from the original javascript app this was converted from (http://www.infinality.net/files/confluence-to-mediawiki-converter/)
Additionally there are some issues where different file structure and confluence syntax are used for different products.
